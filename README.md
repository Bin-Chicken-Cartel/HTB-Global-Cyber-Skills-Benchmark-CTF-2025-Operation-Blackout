## Event Information

- **Event Name:** Global Cyber Skills Benchmark CTF 2025: Operation Blackout
- **Host:** HackTheBox
- **Format:** Jeopardy-style CTF
- **Theme:** Operation Blackout - Critical Infrastructure Security
- **Challenges:** 66 challenges across 16 categories

## Event Overview

In a world where advanced technology and cyber capabilities have reshaped global power dynamics, one nation‚Äîthe Empire of Volnaya‚Äîhas emerged as a significant threat to international stability. Volnaya, a state with a long history of espionage and authoritarian rule, believes that instigating a new Cold War era will position them as a superpower once again. To accomplish this, Volnaya's intelligence agency has launched Operation Blackout: a carefully orchestrated cyber campaign targeting critical infrastructure across rival nations.

The Empire of Volnaya's operatives are highly trained in cyber warfare, utilizing advanced persistent threats (APTs) and covert networks to avoid detection. Their plan is to plunge cities into chaos by destabilizing power grids, disrupting financial systems, and compromising emergency services, all designed to push global powers into a state of fear and distrust. With society on the brink of chaos, Volnaya hopes to assert its dominance and solidify its influence by forcing a new era of Cold War tensions.

In response, a coalition of global powers has formed an elite task force‚ÄîTask Force Phoenix‚Äîcomposed of the world's top cyber operatives. Your mission is to thwart Operation Blackout before it destabilizes nations and creates a geopolitical crisis. Each phase of your mission will bring you closer to unraveling Volnaya's plot and exposing its ambitions for world dominance.

### Your Role

As a member of Task Force Phoenix, you are at the forefront of countering Volnaya's cyber onslaught. Equipped with advanced cybersecurity tools, intelligence, and the latest in counter-APT strategies, you and your team must dismantle the infrastructure of Operation Blackout and neutralize the threat of a new Cold War and Cyber Dark Age.
